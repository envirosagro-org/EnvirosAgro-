I've updated the primary call-to-action button in `components/ScaleUpSummit.tsx`. It now reads "Secure Your Spot" and has refined styling with a `bg-agro-600` background, `hover:bg-agro-700` for hover, `py-4` vertical padding, and `rounded-xl` border-radius to give it a more premium and globally engaging look.

Is there anything else I can assist you with?
