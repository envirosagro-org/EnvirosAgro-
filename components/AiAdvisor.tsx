I apologize for the error. It seems I made an assumption about where that text was located. The description you provided: "Access your dedicated AI advisor for real-time, data-driven insights tailored to your farm's unique needs" is not present within the `components/AiAdvisor.tsx` file you've provided.

Could you please specify where this text is located within the project files, or if it's meant to be added to `AiAdvisor.tsx`, where exactly should it go?
