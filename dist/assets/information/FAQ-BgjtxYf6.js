Social Influenza Disease (SI-D), however, is a specific socio-psychological framework within the Social Agriculture thrust used to identify and treat harmful narratives and fractures that block development. One is the goal; the other is a primary obstacle we diagnose."},{question:"What is the EnvirosAgro Sustainability Framework?",answer:"It is a holistic model organizing agricultural development into five interconnected thrusts: Social (SA), Environmental (EA), Health (HA), Technical (TA), and Industrial (IA). This framework ensures that farming practices are not just productive but also socially equitable, environmentally regenerative, and economically scalable."},{question:"How is the Sustainable Time Constant m(t) calculated?",answer:"The m(t) score is calculated using our proprietary formula: m = √[((Dn × In) × C(a)) / S]. It takes into account natural variables like rainfall (Dn) and soil moisture (In), multiplied by the Sustainability Coefficient C(a), and divided by crop requirements (S). A higher 'm' value indicates greater resilience against environmental shocks."},{question:"What is an ESIN and why do I need one?",answer:"ESIN stands for EnvirosAgro Social Identification Number. It is a unique digital identifier assigned to registered farmers, groups, and societies. It serves as your 'sustainability passport,' allowing you to track your impact, access financial grants, and verify the authenticity of your produce in the supply chain."},{question:"How does EnvirosAgro protect my data?",answer:"We champion 'Data Sovereignty.'
